2.2 Radarblock’s Unique Proposition for Radiant’s Twitter:
Radarblock’s unique proposition for Radiant illustrates the insights it brings to the well-known strategic advantages of Radiant. ​​It empowers Radarblock with an edge in execution and volatile market conditions while simultaneously providing the Radiant team with an insight into Radarblock’s thought processes.

2.2.1 Suggested Key Messaging that Fosters Growth:
Radarblock will work closely with Radiant to create messages that emphasise key values and selling points, tailored to resonate with the existing Radiant community as well as new potential users. Strategic communication of core brand messages is essential for resonating with the audience, standing out from competitors, and making a lasting impression. In line with taking a proactive approach, suggested key messaging can be found below:

Radiant will unify billions of fragmented liquidity
Radiant has secured a notable first-mover advantage in Omnichain lending, being the pioneering cross-chain lending protocol in DeFi. It facilitates effortless asset deposit and borrowing across chains. Radiant aims to expand its presence on every EVM chain, streamlining transactions for lending, borrowing, bridging, and swapping between chains.

DeFi 3.0 empowers users that add value to the protocol
Through their dLP model, Radiant addresses mercenary liquidity and mitigates issues seen in DeFi 1.0 with valueless governance tokens. They’ve established a sustainable approach, curbing unnecessary emissions and rewarding users for adding real value to the protocol. Any decline in TVL, due to the absence of mercenary farmers, leads to higher APR for committed members. This is supported by extended lock periods and significant retention of ARB tokens from Radiant’s campaign, with two-thirds of claimants holding the token.

Radiant is safety-driven
Lending markets in DeFi are notorious for being susceptible to exploit risk, as evidenced by the composition of the rekt leaderboard. To counter such risks, Radiant has made extensive investments in audits from notable agencies such as Open Zeppelin and has implemented an ImmuneFi bug bounty program. Radiant’s choice of viewing decisions from the lens of security has been clear in the implementation of their Chaos Labs dashboard, which helps detect any abrupt protocol interaction.

Radiant has excellent user metrics
While a majority of protocols rely on unsustainable incentive mechanisms to acquire and retain users, Radiant shines as the juggernaut of sustainable growth. Radarblock is confident about Radiant’s continued success and believes such events should be regularly highlighted via social channels as milestones.

Radiant is consistently the preferred money market on Arbitrum.
It has managed to garner the highest TVL on Arbitrum after AAVE. Given the popular participation in Arbitrum’s STIP program, Radiant has managed to hold attention in a highly competitive ecosystem.

$RDNT holders have been increasing over time
Holders of $RDNT have been increasing over time, showcasing a steady rise in interest around the project. It reflects a direct interest from investors in the project, which reflects positively for Radiant in the coming bull market.

Radiant has outperformed its competitors in revenue generated
It has accrued more than $3.8M in revenue over the last 180 days with a competitive price-to-fee ratio. Despite the crippling bear market, Radiant not only launched but also delivered upon economic fundamentals.

Highlight Radiant users’ behaviour
To celebrate their users, Radiant can utilise data from Dune dashboard and Chaos Labs dashboard to announce general trends on social channels. Additionally, Radarblock will actively cover community participation in various events held on Discord in close collaboration with Radiant’s Discord team.

2.2.2 Supplementary Messaging for Radiant
Radiant embraces Longtermism, prioritising the sustainable future of the system. The protocol iterates strategically, evident in the transformation from Radiant V1 to V2.

It catalyses user acquisition on new chains, fostering DeFi ecosystem growth through chain-based incentives.

The team exhibits nimbleness by swiftly listing $ARB as collateral within a month of its launch.

Radiant’s commitment to security is reflected in the implementation of a timelock, addressing potential contingencies in contract upgradability.

2.2.3 Leveraging Market Commentary for Messaging:
Market Commentary is a potent emotional engagement tool, reaching a broad audience for greater impact. While pre-planned key messages form the foundation of our content strategy, Radarblock’s team captures real-time CT information related to Radiant and Web3 in general. The information is then linked with the established key or supplementary messaging to craft unique yet cohesive content for Radiant’s Twitter.

Insightful analysis and thought-provoking perspectives in market commentary enhance engagement and expand the platform’s influence and reach. It will allow Radiant to put forth a perspective or insight which only they could’ve brought to the table owing to their messaging. Crucial for capturing external narratives resonating with our views, it fosters a continuous loop between potential users and Radiant.

2.2.4 Taking the Novel Marketing Approach:
We believe that consistent innovation is one key factor that distinguishes Radarblock from others. In the spirit of the true degeneracy and “ze culture”, we’ve created a few content pieces to highlight that besides the disciplined approach followed in this proposal, Radarblock remains degen at heart. The videos below are a testament to the same.

3.2 Radarblock’s Unique Proposition for Radiant’s PR:
Radarblock understands that every penny must be spent through a data-backed approach and clear intent. However, the current standards in press releases struggle to tackle the same. We believe that our extensive research on PR strategies and frameworks changes that and we’d love to expand upon the same.

3.2.1 Data-Backed Story Telling:
Radarblock realises that current market peers struggle to track several target KPIs which allow success assessment. It may prevent them from assessing the need for PR altogether. On the other hand, our data dashboards allow Radiant to evaluate the landscape and competitor scenario throughout the engagement which lets Radiant deploy PR on data-backed decisions.

We use metrics like SOV that monitor the competitive landscape incrementally with other supporting metrics such as sentiment analysis, website traffic, media mentions and more. These metrics are expanded upon in detail in Chapter 4.2.

This analytical approach is still novel in Web3 and allows for a more comprehensive PR strategy. Radarblock would be actively measuring the performance of PR efforts across the ecosystem and consulting the Radiant team on how to leverage data to their benefit.

We also resonate with the Peso Evaluation Model on the four different media types:

Paid Media

Earned Media

Shared Media

Owned Media

Aligning all of these moves us towards the identified goals of engagement. The data-backed approach also builds trust and support within the community due to our transparency and logical backing.

3.2.2 Network Amplification and Distribution
Radarblock assembles an extensive distribution network consisting of evangelists, community leaders, KOLs, liquid funds, potential investors, and more from the Radiant ecosystem. The alignment of the key stakeholders serves in favour as consolidation of central themes occurs through this exercise. These themes build wide scale trust and promote key ideals of Radiant. This is the culture upon which the Radiant team has thrived hitherto, and Radarblock would like to contribute significantly to the same.

3.2.3 Lean Methods and Leveraging Market Research
Radarblock is proud of our lean agility in operations which allows overnight pivots in line with market volatility. We have facilitated complete campaigns end-to-end in less than 24 hours without compromising on quality. Our team works round the clock, monitoring market situations, and consolidates relevant market insights that can be utilised for the deployment of any press release. We have done the same several times in our previous engagements and observed massive traction as discussed in the Good Entry Case Study expanded in Chapter 6.2. We also deploy consistent feedback loops that help us iterate our strategy and pivot to high-performing sectors and amplify growth where it is required. This allows for the concentration of efforts where they yield maximum results.

Chapter 4: Performance Metrics
Effective evaluation of strategies and campaigns relies on robust performance metrics, serving as vital tools in deciphering the resonance of our content with the audience.

These metrics empower us to make data-driven decisions, optimising efforts for meaningful results. Here’s how Radarblock plans to leverage performance metrics for the benefit of Radiant in the context of PR and Twitter:

4.1 Twitter Performance Metrics
Monitoring Twitter performance metrics is crucial for evaluating the impact of our content strategy and making informed decisions to optimize our Twitter presence and attract more users.

4.1.1 Target KPIs and Success Assessment for Twitter:
Radarblock will conduct a detailed analysis of target KPIs on an ongoing basis during their engagement with Radiant. It helps Radarblock analysts calibrate their efforts and assurance rate of achieving an expected outcome. The following outcomes can be expected within 3 months of engagement:

Followers Gained
Radiant’s Twitter handle has the potential to grow by 16% or more in the best-case scenario, 10% in an average case, and 6% in a subpar case.

Post-Impressions
Radarblock plans to execute three or more viral campaigns through Radiant’s Twitter handle in the best-case scenario. In an average case, two viral campaigns are expected, while in a subpar case, only one campaign is expected. This leads to a significant increase in impressions.

Engagement Rates
Engagement increase ranging from 30% to 50% is expected. This surge in engagement showcases the growing interest and interaction of users with the content.

Profile Conversion Rate
Radarblock expects a growth of 40% to 80% in profile conversions, which indicates that viewers are becoming users.

4.1.2 Breakdown of KPIs for Twitter:
Expected outcomes and their respective target KPIs about Twitter are listed below:

Followers Gained
Analysing the number of followers gained within 30 days can provide insights into content success and campaign effectiveness. Significant growth in followers indicates increased engagement and expanded audience reach.

Post-Impressions
To increase post impressions, the target KPI for running two viral campaigns should be set. Post impressions provide insights into post consistency and content quality.

Engagement Rates
Higher engagement rates reflect genuine interest and involvement, guiding content refinement. It is a measure of user interaction with a post and indicates creativity and viewer interest.

Chapter 5: Timeline
The timeline can be seen with its various phases here while it can be seen in a tabulated format here.

Chapter 6: Citations and Case Studies
6.1 Satori Finance
A comprehensive overview of the client’s case study can be found here.

Satori is a decentralised financial derivatives platform that features an “off-chain aggregation and on-chain settlement” design, combining the security and transparency of a decentralised exchange with the speed and usability of a centralised exchange. It caters to retail and professional traders alike, offering a user-friendly interface and advanced SDK and APIs for integrating trading tools with other systems.

The client raised their $10M seed capital from notable players such as Jump Crypto, Coinbase, D1 Ventures, and many more. However, consistency and themes of Twitter content posed challenges to a lean team occupied with product updates. Perpetual DEX space is one of the most emerging markets in Web3, with strong players like GMX and Gains Network. It is usually hard for newer products to establish themselves such that they have strong user support.

Radarblock was brought in to increase the client’s Twitter activity in a way that amplifies their awareness and cements them as a major upcoming Perp platform in various new ecosystems. The Radarblock team immediately got to work and figured out the best possible positioning for Satori after brainstorming with their core team. It was decided that the biggest benefit of Satori was their Unified Order Book model which could solve the fragmentation of a traders’ liquidity. Overall, unification of liquidity was a mission that rang just as true for Satori as it does for Radiant.

6.1.1 Execution
For Twitter, a descriptive content calendar was created such that it:

Explained the mechanism of Satori using threads and single tweets.

Appealed to the “left-curve” audience using memes related to market conditions or recent happenings in CT.

Focused more on the Asian audience by rebranding the mascot, catering to the existing user base.

Interacted with chains upon which Satori was deployed by engaging in their latest Twitter developments.

Beyond the planned Twitter content calendar, we brought exposure to Satori on Twitter using three different avenues:

We engaged in comments with CT personalities such as Andrew Kang and Awawat to garner more exposure for Satori.

We were on top of market events that were relevant for Satori such as liquidations and macroeconomic legislations.

We coordinated with various Web3 service providers such as Galxe and OKX to ensure smooth campaign operations and quick troubleshooting. Co-marketing was also catered to within our scope of work.

We outreached, negotiated, and deployed KOL threads strategically placed around narratives that were popular at that time.

For PR, we hoped to cement Satori’s image as the pioneer perp platform on Linea. We coordinated with relevant parties for Satori’s participation in the PR article and also interacted with other notable protocols that were featured in the same.

6.1.2 Outcome
Our various execution efforts paid off with Satori’s followers increasing by 582%, going from 21,311 on June 01, 2023, to at 153,000 as of January 4, 2024. Owing to our well-timed market commentaries and capitalising upon narratives as they came, the impressions rose by 733% in that same duration, garnering them 2.53M views in total. Impressions are an important metric for determining the visibility of the protocol while the engagement rate tells you how much people enjoy your tweets [Engagement/Impressions]. We were able to scale it by 394% establishing our content as engaging for the larger audience. Besides that, “profile clicks” – measuring how absorbing the content is – rose by 199%, signalling that our content was making the audience click more on our profile.

6.2 Good Entry
A comprehensive overview of the client’s case study can be found here.

GoodEntry is a protected perpetual protocol that allows retail users to trade without getting liquidated by price. Starting in February of 2023, they quickly rose to fame because of their sticky community and their break-fast-repair-fast approach. They ended up becoming one of the grantees of the Arbitrum STIP program which was a moment of prestige for any young protocol.

At the beginning of this year, Radarblock was approached to be the in-house CMO and the marketing arm of GoodEntry. The team wanted to bootstrap their marketing from scratch such that they could foster community support. While GoodEntry eventually had a first-mover advantage in the space with a working alpha product, Radarblock started working with them while they were still developing it. Similar to Radiant, GoodEntry’s story is one of persistence and triumph within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Working with the GoodEntry team also allowed us to have the opportunity to interact with multiple other Arbitrum protocols, which refined our understanding of the Arbitrum ecosystem as a whole.

6.2.1 Execution
GoodEntry’s 0-to-1 journey has allowed us to transition from perp-specific content, pass through product-led marketing, and arrive at TGE-specific content. The journey was filled with multiple iterations which were supported by the core team and allowed us to foster a community while working alongside the Discord team.

Besides a well-documented Twitter content plan, we executed the following strategies that helped cement the importance of GoodEntry across CT:

First-in-space market commentaries: We deeply understood the importance of market commentaries and were often the first ones to tweet about how the liquidated users could’ve used GoodEntry to guard against scam wicks.

KOL management: We worked alongside the lead KOL for GE to help proofread and monitor the traction of KOL threads. GoodEntry had a total of 20 KOLs who were aided by Radarblock’s KOL briefs for GoodEntry’s new iteration, Degen Mode.

Partnership Marketing: Radarblock coordinated with the larger Arbitrum ecosystem to prepare for the GE World Tour. It was an AMA marathon that aided in the wide publicity of the incoming TGE scheduled for 27th November 2023. The World Tour concluded with a long-form summary of the discussions that were held on spaces with the partners.

6.2.2 Outcome
Radarblock managed to scale GoodEntry’s Twitter from 0 to 14,500 followers, building a cohesive community along the way. Toward the TGE, GoodEntry managed to capture decent mind-share because of appropriate quest usage, Twitter marketing, and KOL support, sending the cumulative profile clicks to 18,000. It was corroborated by a 1.7M rise in impressions, a 1,500% gain. GoodEntry’s content – due to effective leveraging of comarketing and KOL support – had begun reaching the whitespace masses consistently.

Because of the memetic value of the content posted, such as an overemphasis on key themes of “$GOOD” and “One Team One Dream,” the engagement rate saw a rise of 334% as the audience became involved in copypasta practices. Rising popularity across CT brought us the attention of notable influencers, such as ChicoCrypto, who graced the occasion with coverage of GoodEntry.

Development, iteration, and execution of marketing strategies, handling urgent obstacles, being involved with other partners, KOLs, and service providers led up to the grand day. Their token launch was hosted on 27th November 2023 and sold out within a minute, all while being a fair launch worth 1.5M USD (10M FDV) with equal terms for all.

6.3 API3
A comprehensive overview of the client’s case study can be found here

API3 is among the top oracles in the Web3 space with 140+ data feeds on 16 blockchains. Their flagship products, dAPIs, are aggregated from first-party oracles directly on the native chain. This means that you always know where your data comes from and never have to rely on cross-chain bridges, a centralised point of failure for a dApp. The dAPI aggregation contract resides on the same chain as the consumer dApp, meaning the data is never bridged over and exposed to bridge exploits. This maximises the reliability and transparency of our feeds, resulting in safer DeFi for everyone.

Radarblock was approached by the client to build an institutional narrative that converts to actual users. They were gearing up for the launch of their managed dAPIs. Oracles being the backbone of DeFi allow the whole ecosystem to function seamlessly with their price feeds. The task was to help dAPI technology gain maximum exposure while maintaining an institutional outlook.

6.3.1 Execution
Radarblock started by auditing the social presence of the client. Then, based on the developments and pre-existing Medium content, Radarblock drafted a basic press release that was to go out through mass traditional media channels.

After comparing quotations for various PR channels, Radarblock optimised pricing and sent out a press release to various major media outlets such as Yahoo Finance and AP News.

6.3.2 Outcome
The final press release was covered by 74 different sources with a cumulative reach of 30 million. The outcomes can be seen in the first, second, third, and fourth images.
